# 🚀 My Web Dev Learning Journey

Hey there! 👋  
This repo contains a collection of basic projects I've built while learning web development. Each one helped me understand a different concept — from HTML structure to JavaScript interactivity.

I’m still learning, and this is my way of tracking progress and sharing my growth publicly 💻✨
