# 🚀 My Web Dev Learning Journey

Hey there! 👋  

This repo contains a collection of projects I’ve been building while learning **web development**.  
Each project focuses on different concepts — from **HTML & CSS basics** to **JavaScript interactivity**,  
and even **full-stack applications** with backend integration.  

I’m still learning, and this repo is my way of tracking progress and sharing my growth publicly 💻✨
